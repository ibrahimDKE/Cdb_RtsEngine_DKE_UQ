\section{Experiments Results}
%
Next, we present our results which demonstrates the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.
%
Firstly, we test the quality of the results produced by our algorithms on the Flights database in Section \ref{sec:results_flights}.
%
Then, we perform similar experiments on the GoCard database in Section \ref{sec:results_gocard}, to show that the results are consistent.
%
Later, we present our detailed results on the efficiency of our algorithms in Section \ref{sec:results_eff}.
%
Finally, we show our experiments on the time limit parameter in Section \ref{sec:results_timelimit} and cost estimation in Section \ref{sec:results_cost}.
